# Lakehouse-Architecture--Azure

Comprehensive Data Pipeline and Reporting Solution Using Lakehouse Architecture
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a secure, scalable, and efficient data pipeline based on the Lakehouse Architecture. It integrates multiple Azure services to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data, providing a structured approach to data governance and advanced visualization using Microsoft Power BI.
The solution is tailored to address real-world challenges such as dynamic table ingestion, secure data handling, and efficient transformation for analytics and reporting.

Objectives
•	Build an end-to-end data pipeline capable of handling diverse datasets.
•	Optimize data transformations with a modular Lakehouse structure (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers).
•	Deliver actionable insights via interactive dashboards.
•	Implement secure authentication and centralized management of sensitive credentials.

Tools and Technologies
1.	Azure Data Factory (ADF): Orchestrates data ingestion using parameterized pipelines.
2.	Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2): Stores raw, cleaned, and enriched datasets.
3.	Azure Databricks: Performs data transformation and aggregation.
4.	Azure Synapse Analytics: Hosts analytics-ready views with serverless SQL.
5.	Azure Key Vault: Manages secrets and credentials securely.
6.	Azure Active Directory (AAD): Implements secure authentication and access control.
7.	Microsoft Power BI: Creates interactive dashboards for data visualization.

Pipeline Workflow
1. Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)
•	Azure Data Factory (ADF):
o	Configured ADF to extract data from the on-premises SQL database using parameterized pipelines for flexibility.
o	Stored raw data in the Bronze Layer of ADLS Gen2, representing the unprocessed data stage.
2. Secure Access and Authentication
•	Azure Key Vault: Managed credentials such as database connection strings and SAS tokens securely.
•	Azure Active Directory (AAD): Enforced secure access policies to ensure only authorized users and services could access pipeline components.
3. Data Transformation (Silver Layer)
•	Azure Databricks:
o	Mounted ADLS Gen2 using SAS tokens retrieved from Azure Key Vault.
o	Transformed raw data from the Bronze Layer, applying validation and cleaning logic.
o	Stored processed data in the Silver Layer, making it structured and analysis-ready.
4. Data Enrichment (Gold Layer)
•	Azure Databricks:
o	Performed advanced aggregations and domain-specific transformations on Silver Layer data.
o	Stored enriched datasets in the Gold Layer for consumption by analytical tools.
5. Data Analytics
•	Azure Synapse Analytics:
o	Imported Gold Layer data using serverless SQL.
o	Created SQL views for each table in the Gold Layer to simplify data querying.
6. Data Visualization
•	Power BI:
o	Connected Power BI to Synapse Analytics to build dynamic dashboards.
o	Delivered interactive visualizations to provide actionable insights to stakeholders.

Key Features
1.	Dynamic Table Ingestion: ADF pipelines dynamically fetch and process tables using metadata-driven logic (e.g., lookup activities).
2.	Lakehouse Layers:
o	Bronze Layer: Raw data storage.
o	Silver Layer: Cleaned, structured data.
o	Gold Layer: Aggregated, analytics-ready data.
3.	Security:
o	Secrets managed with Azure Key Vault.
o	Authentication and access control via Azure Active Directory.
4.	Interactive Reporting: Power BI dashboards enable real-time insights.

Process Workflow
Pipeline Diagram
 
1.	Lookup Activity: Fetches schema and table metadata from the source database for dynamic execution.
2.	ForEach Activity: Iterates through metadata to process each table dynamically using copy activities.
3.	Bronze-to-Silver Transformation Notebook: Cleans and validates raw data in Databricks.
4.	Silver-to-Gold Transformation Notebook: Aggregates and enriches data for analytical purposes.
